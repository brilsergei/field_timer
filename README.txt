h1. Field Timer

h2. Description

This module provides field wich can be displayed as timer/countdown. Module uses 
2 jQuery plugins: County 
(http://www.egrappler.com/free-jquery-count-down-plugin-county/) and jQuery 
Countdown plugin (http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html).

h2. Drupal Installation

1. Install this module as usual.
2. To be able to use County and jQuery Countdown plugins download them to 
sites/all/libraries/county and sites/all/libraries/jquery.countdown. This module
supports jQuery Countdown 1.6.0-1.6.3 versions.
3. Remove first css rule from sites/all/libraries/county/css/county.css. It 
changes font size on the site. Plugin author was notified about this problem. 
I hope he fix it.
